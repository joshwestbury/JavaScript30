    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = 100;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // let name = 'josh';
    // let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);
    // name = 'jose'
    // console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
      // now here is the problem!
      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
      // In other words, team is not the array. It is merely a reference to the original array. 

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!  
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
      //when you pass slice() nothing it will make a copy of the entire arryay.
    team2[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(team2, players);
      //now team2 is updated but players is left untouched.

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(team3, players);


    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(team4, players);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Lux'
    console.log(team5, players);


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Josh Westbury',
      age: 38
    }

    // and think we make a copy:
      //you cannot do this:
    
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
      //this is just a reference to person. So by updating captain, we update person.

    // how do we take a copy instead?
  
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number:99 });
    console.log(cap2, person)
      //note that Object.assign only works one level deep for objects.

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
